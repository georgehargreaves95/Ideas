Project 1: Forked CompactCalendarView (CCV) {

Context: Currently working with CCV in Kotlin and need different functionality that requires significant changes to exsiting codebase. Therefore I will fork off from SundeepK repo and alter to suit my needs better.

Goals: 
- Implement more attributes to allow font styles and global themes.
- Adapt current event marker functionality to provide stable and unique ids
- Implmenet different event class types to extend calendar functionality 

Status: Pre-planning/Concept exploration
