## Project 1: Forked CompactCalendarView (CCV) {

**Context**: Currently working with CCV in Kotlin and need different functionality that requires significant changes to exsiting codebase. Therefore I will fork off from SundeepK repo and alter to suit my needs better.

**Goals**: 
- Implement more attributes to allow font styles and global themes.
- Adapt current event marker functionality to provide stable and unique ids
- Implmenet different event class types to extend calendar functionality 

**Status:** Discontinued

}

## Project 2: SpacePort parking app {
 **Context**: At my current office there is extremely limited parking. During a company Hackathon last year my team worked on a parking app that would allow users to make bookings and monitor the available spaces. My colleague continued working on it over time and I rejoined the project to implement the mobile front end with Junior from my team. 
 
 **Goals**
 - Implement a basic UI that allows users to track parking availability at the RotaCloud office
 - Maintain best practice throughout project development
 - Deepen understanding of ReactNative technologies
 - Output a useful, efficient, and beautiful app that our colleagues at RC will love to use!

**Status:** Actively being developed
